## Write  **[M.]**    

Since April 2014, I found a `R` package `knitr`, that support generating `markdown` files very easy, and then found `Github` + `Jekyll` support maintain a static page using `markdown`. I got it.

Thanks [yihui Xie](http://yihui.name), [lhzhang](http://lhzhang.com) and [Mark Reid](http://mark.reid.name/) for the beautiful page styles.
